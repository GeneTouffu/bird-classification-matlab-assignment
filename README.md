omputer Vision and Image Analysis – Bird Species Recognition
Overview

This project implements computer vision and image analysis methods in Matlab (R2023b / R2024b) to recognise bird species from the CUB_200_2011 dataset. The program applies image preprocessing, feature extraction, object detection, and classification techniques to automatically analyse bird images and classify them into known species.

The assignment demonstrates:

Knowledge of image analysis and object detection methods.

Application of feature extraction methods for recognition tasks.

Development and evaluation of object recognition classifiers.

Use of good software engineering practices (modular, well-commented, reproducible code).

All code is written in Matlab and can be executed on the University of Canberra lab computers or the Nutanix SciTech GPU Virtual Desktop.
